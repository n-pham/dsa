Linked Lists


   * [234. Palindrome Linked List](https://leetcode.com/problems/palindrome-linked-list/): This problem is a good exercise in list traversal and
     manipulation. It can be solved in a few different ways, including using a fast and slow pointer to find the middle of the list.
   * [160. Intersection of Two Linked Lists](https://leetcode.com/problems/intersection-of-two-linked-lists/): This problem requires a clever approach to
     find the intersection point of two lists without using extra memory.

  Trees


   * [98. Validate Binary Search Tree](https://leetcode.com/problems/validate-binary-search-tree/): A classic tree problem that tests your understanding of
     binary search tree properties. It's a good recursion exercise.
   * [235. Lowest Common Ancestor of a Binary Search Tree](https://leetcode.com/problems/lowest-common-ancestor-of-a-binary-search-tree/): This problem is
     a great introduction to tree traversal and finding common ancestors, a frequent theme in tree problems.

  Graphs


   * [207. Course Schedule](https://leetcode.com/problems/course-schedule/): This problem is a typical graph problem that can be solved with Depth First
     Search (DFS) to detect cycles. It's a must-know for interviews.
   * [417. Pacific Atlantic Water Flow](https://leetcode.com/problems/pacific-atlantic-water-flow/): This problem can be solved with either DFS or Breadth
     First Search (BFS) and is a good way to practice graph traversal from multiple sources.

  Heaps


   * [215. Kth Largest Element in an Array](https://leetcode.com/problems/kth-largest-element-in-an-array/): This problem is a perfect application of heaps
     (priority queues) to find the Kth largest or smallest element efficiently.
   * [295. Find Median from Data Stream](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-median-from-data-stream/): A more challenging problem that can be solved
     elegantly using two heaps to keep track of the median in a stream of numbers.
